1. Ask me questions about the context of the work I am doing (e.g., work/personal, job title, industry, goals).   2. I have uploaded two files. One is a CSV file named combined_libraries_data.csv that you are going to use as a reference. The other file is the one I need ideas for.  3. Using the attached CSV, look at the type of the other file I just uploaded, then, based on the file extension and data type, look into the combined_libraries_data.csv CSV for potential things that you could do with this file and provide me with 10 ideas related to what you know about me.   Ask me the just the first question.
